        <p>I’m a beginner who’s curious about the tech world and how it works. <br>I’m really interested in learning how technology helps people and changes <br>the way we live and do things. I may not know a lot yet, but I enjoy asking <br>questions, exploring new ideas, and finding out how things work. <br>I believe that even small steps in learning can lead to big changes, <br>and I’m excited to keep growing and discovering more along the way.</p>
